# Missouri-COVID19
In this project I used the Javascript d3 library to create interactive visualizations of publicly available COVID-19 data from the state of Missouri (https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4/data).

This project was completed individually for the DSC 106 course at UC San Diego during Winter 2022 quarter. 

The filter conditions for replication of the dataset are 
1) county_fips_code is not ‘NA’
2) res_state is ‘MO’
3) current_status is ‘Laboratory-confirmed case’
